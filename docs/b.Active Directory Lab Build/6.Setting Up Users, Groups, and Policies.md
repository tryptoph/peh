- look at OUs, objects, domain policies as if we are system administrator
- I create a folder to contain only groups called "groups"
- I copied administrator two times : one for another user , another for SQL service to run SQL server
- in description write password is what many system administrators do
- add new user with clicking right mouse
- Create a file share
- set the service account 
```cmd
setspn -a HYDRA-DC/SQLService.MARVEL.local:60111 MARVEL\SQLService
```
and check and query by 
```cmd
setspn -T MARVEL.local -Q */*
```

>[!info]
>service principal name 'SPN'

- set up a group policy : disable windows defender to perform attacks

>[! issue]
>When setting up the clients and domain controller for the AD part of the course, the current instruction to setup a GPO for turning off windows defender no longer works. 
>
>There's another way to achieve the intended effects though: Once, while setting up the clients with the administrator account, go into the "Virus & threat protection settings" and turn "Tamper protection" off (this setting would prevent gpos from changing security settings. This only needs to be done once as this setting does not change on reboot.)
>
> Then, instead of enabling "Admin templates -> Windows Defender Antivirus -> Turn Off Windows Defender" (which does not work anymore) at the GPO part 
> 
> Use the following two GPOs: 
> Enable "Admin templates -> Windows Defender Antivirus -> Real-time Protection -> Turn off real-time protection" (This setting requires tamper protection to be off) 
> Disable "Admin templates -> Network -> Network Connections -> Windows Defender Firewall -> Domain Profile -> Protect all network connections" 
> 
> -Now the windows real time protection and domain firewall stay disabled across reboots of the clients.
> 
> -_There is an even easier way though_^^ Using dewalts pimpmyad script this (and more fixes) are already automated for you: [https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmyadlab/blob/main/pimpmyadlab.ps1](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmyadlab/blob/main/pimpmyadlab.ps1 "https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmyadlab/blob/main/pimpmyadlab.ps1") (thanks @Dewalt for the help figuring this out)

- Enforce the policy
- set a static IP address
