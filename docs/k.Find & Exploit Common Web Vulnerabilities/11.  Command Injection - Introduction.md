- command injection is dangerous : if founded u can compromise the application and the host
- app take input from user and pass it to function that execute it as code ; which is against secure development principal : not mix data and code.
- eval is evil cuz it executes data passed to it.
- in JS :
```js
let userInput='7*7'
eval(userInput)  (get 49)
```
- in php
```shell

php -a (interactive php)
$userInput='whoami';
system($userInput); (get kali)
```

>[!warning]
>not use eval and system
>never trsut input
