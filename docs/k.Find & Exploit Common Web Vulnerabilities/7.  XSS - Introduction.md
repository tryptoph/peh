- XSS execute JS on victim browser and control over the application for that user.
- Types : 
	1. reflected XSS : script u try to inject comes from the current HTTP-request ; u send a request and u get a response and that script is included in the response ;u only talk to yourself unless the payload is in URI (push smn to click it) ![[2023-08-23 21_23_56-Window.png]]
	2. stored XSS: more powerful ; payload is stored in database and retrieved later .(attack other user)![[2023-08-23 21_23_35-Window.png]]
	3. DOM-based XSS: client-side has some vulnerable JS that uses untrusted input instead of having vulnerability server side ![[2023-08-23 21_30_24-Window.png]]

- in dev-tools of web page(inspect) : in console: u can do `alert(1)` 
- or ,since this command can be filtered by browsers now  u can :
`print()` and `prompt("hello")`
- also : `function logKey(event){console.log(event.key)}`
`document.addEventListener('keydown',logKey)`
- or replace `console.log` by `fetch`
