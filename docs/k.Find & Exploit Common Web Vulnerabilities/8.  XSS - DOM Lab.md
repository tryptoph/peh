- this is DOM-based XSS : cuz in network tab there is no request going and coming back to server : vulnerability within client .
	`<script>prompt(1)</script>` not work cuz even if added to page , but not called , so we need trigger.


>[!note]
>if it was a part of the page when it loaded , it would have been triggered


```JS
	<img src=x onerror="prompt(1)">
```

- Now we want to forward the user to another page:

```JS
	<img src=x onerror="window.location.href='https://tcm-sec.com'">
```
